* Public policy issues raised by RSED
1. What happens to RSED's profit?
   - Can RSED convert its profits into private gain?
   - Should the rules be tightened?
2. Should California taxpayers fund out-of-state charter schools?
3. Is there too much opportunity for fraud?
   - Should oversight be improved?
4. Is the SB740 rent subsidy program being abused?
   - RSED leases from itself
   - Subsidies continue forever
5. Should sweeps be allowed into related non-profit entities? unrelated for-profit entities?
6. Does RSED serve the children it claims to serve?
   - Do the benefits outweight the costs?
   - Who benefits? Who pays the costs?
7. Should local school districts appoint or elect a charter school board member?
8. How transparent should charter schools be? Transparent to whom?
9. How well is RSED meeting the legislature's goals?
10. How well is RSED meeting the CDE's goals?
* A key tension: Are charter schools really public?
